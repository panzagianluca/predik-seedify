# Predik Seedify Execution Plan

## Overview
- **Objective:** Deliver a gasless, BNB-native prediction market with ERC-4337 smart accounts, AI-assisted resolution, and Spanish-first UX for the Seedify hackathon.
- **Timeline:** 14 days (Week 1 = Contracts & Infrastructure, Week 2 = Integration, Seeding, Demo).
- **Success Criteria:** Fully functioning gasless trading flow, 10 Argentine markets live on BNB Testnet, demo video, and submission package ready.

## Phase 0 ‚Äî Access & Research Prerequisites (Day 0) ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED on October 23, 2025**

**Completed Items:**
- ‚úÖ Neon Database created and connected (`neondb` on `ep-floral-recipe-adwqh01g`)
- ‚úÖ Biconomy Super Transactions API configured (API Key: `mee_CTa...`, Project ID: `79933c68...`)
- ‚úÖ Privy Social Login configured (App ID: `cmh3yqmdl...`, Secret stored)
- ‚úÖ DelphAI Oracle address documented (`0xA95E99848a318e37F128aB841b0CF693c1f0b4D1`)
- ‚úÖ Vercel Blob token added for avatar uploads
- ‚úÖ All credentials added to `.env.local` and `.env.local.example`
- ‚úÖ Database connection fixed to handle Vercel build (no env during build time)
- ‚úÖ PostHog analytics removed (deferred for hackathon)
- ‚úÖ Changes committed and pushed to GitHub

**Notes:**
- Using **Biconomy Super Transactions** (new gasless solution, not legacy paymaster/bundler)
- Privy callbacks configured for `predik.io` and `www.predik.io`
- DelphAI uses on-chain oracle contract (no API key needed, just contract interface)
- Neon connection string uses pooled connection for serverless compatibility

**Environment Variables Set:**
```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://neondb_owner:***@ep-floral-recipe-adwqh01g-pooler.c-2.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require

```

**Next Steps:**
- ‚úÖ Ready to proceed with Phase 1: Smart Contract Development
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to add Vercel environment variables before deploying (DATABASE_URL, PRIVY_APP_SECRET, etc.)

## Risk Mitigation & Contingency
- **LMSR Math Issues:** Maintain simpler CPMM fallback branch if PRBMath precision becomes problematic.
- **Biconomy Downtime:** Prepare manual relayer script to sponsor gas via fallback key.
- **Privy Limitations:** Keep Magic.link or Web3Auth credentials ready as backup social login.
- **Delph AI Delays:** Implement manual oracle override function with multisig for demo reliability.
- **Timeline Buffer:** Reserve final 24 hours for integration surprises and submission polish.
