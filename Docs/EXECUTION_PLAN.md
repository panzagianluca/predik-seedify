---

## Phase 0 — Access & Research Prerequisites (Day 0) ✅ COMPLETED

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED on October 23, 2025**

**Completed Items:**
- ✅ Neon Database created and connected (`neondb` on `ep-floral-recipe-adwqh01g`)
- ✅ Biconomy Super Transactions API configured (API Key: `mee_CTa...`, Project ID: `79933c68...`)
- ✅ Privy Social Login configured (App ID: `cmh3yqmdl...`, Secret stored)
- ✅ **DelphAI Oracle LIVE on BNB Testnet** (`0xA95E99848a318e37F128aB841b0CF693c1f0b4D1`)

    - ✅ Storage schema, access control, role assignments complete
    - ✅ PRBMath helpers for cost function, price computation, invariant checks complete
    - ✅ Buy/sell flows with fee accounting, ERC-1155 mint/burn, collateral transfers complete
    - ✅ Admin utilities (funding, fee withdrawal, parameter updates) complete
    - ✅ State machine (Trading → Resolving → Finalized) complete
    - ✅ requestResolve(), finalize(), redeem() complete and tested
  - ✅ `Router.sol` (batched approve+trade, EIP‑712 structs for AA, treasury fee handling) - 10 tests passing
  - ✅ `Oracle.sol` (DelphAI integration, resolution lifecycle, USDT bond disputes) - 32 tests passing
  - ✅ `Treasury.sol` (60/30/10 fee split, role-based withdrawals, reporting events) - 39 tests passing
  - ✅ `MarketFactory.sol` (ERC-1167 clones, market registry, oracle/router integration) - 26 tests passing

- ✅ Task 2: Extensive Foundry tests written (`test/`)
  - ✅ Unit tests for LMSR math (cost function, gradient, round-trip sanity)
  - ✅ Scenario tests for buy/sell flows with slippage, edge cases (zero liquidity, max shares)
  - ✅ Oracle resolution + dispute window tests (32 comprehensive tests)
  - ✅ Router batched operations + fee distribution tests (10 tests)
  - ✅ Fuzz tests for LMSR invariants and reentrancy guards
  - ✅ **170 total tests passing** across 9 test suites (0 failures, 0 skipped)

- ✅ Task 3: Static analysis & audit prep
  - ✅ All code formatted with `forge fmt`
  - ✅ All contracts build successfully with `forge build`
  - ✅ All tests pass with `forge test -vvv`
  - ✅ Security guards implemented (ReentrancyGuard, SafeERC20, AccessControl)
  - ✅ Audit notes documented in CONTRACT-FIXES-IMPLEMENTATION.md

**Test Results Summary:**
```
Ran 9 test suites: 170 tests passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped
- OracleTest: 32/32 ✅
- TreasuryTest: 39/39 ✅
- MarketFactoryTest: 26/26 ✅
- LMSRMarketResolutionTest: 21/21 ✅
- MockUSDTTest: 22/22 ✅
- Outcome1155Test: 11/11 ✅
- RouterTest: 10/10 ✅
- LMSRMarketTest: 7/7 ✅
- CounterTest: 2/2 ✅
```

**Critical Fixes Completed:**
1. ✅ Factory → Oracle registration args (flipped order)
2. ✅ Outcome1155 mint/burn role grants
3. ✅ getTotalVolume() getter in LMSRMarket
4. ✅ Router multicall reentrancy guards refactored
5. ✅ **Oracle switched from ETH bonds to USDT bonds** (architectural change)
6. ✅ Fee sweep from Market to Treasury implemented
7. ✅ Factory registers markets in Router
8. ✅ Fixed misleading revert name

**Architectural Decisions:**
- **USDT-Native:** All bonds, fees, and collateral use 6-decimal USDT (no ETH)
- **Gasless UX:** Designed for Biconomy Account Abstraction integration
- **DelphAI Integration:** Oracle.sol ready to interact with live DelphAI contract
- **60/30/10 Fee Split:** Treasury distributes to market creator, protocol, liquidity providers

**Documentation Updated:**
- ✅ CONTRACT-FIXES-IMPLEMENTATION.md (all 8 MUST DO items marked complete)
- ✅ ARCHITECTURE.md (USDT bonds, DelphAI integration documented)
- ✅ IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md (95% complete status, all contracts marked complete)

**Next Steps:**
- ✅ **Ready for Phase 2: BNB Testnet Deployment**
- ✅ DelphAI Oracle already live at `0xA95E99848a318e37F128aB841b0CF693c1f0b4D1`
- ⚠️ Need deployment scripts and contract verification plan
