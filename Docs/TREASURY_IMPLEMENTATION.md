# Treasury Implementation

**Status:** ✅ Complete - 39 tests passing  
**Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Contract:** `contracts/Treasury.sol`  
**Tests:** `test/Treasury.t.sol`

## Overview

The Treasury contract is a centralized fee collection and distribution system that handles the three-way split of trading fees between the protocol, market creators, and the oracle provider. It uses role-based access control for secure fund management and provides complete tracking of all fee flows.

## Key Features

### Fee Collection
- **Market Registration:** Markets must be registered before they can collect fees
- **Automatic Split:** Fees are automatically divided based on configured basis points
- **Rounding Handling:** Any rounding remainder goes to the protocol
- **Analytics Tracking:** Total fees per market are tracked for analytics

### Fee Distribution (60/30/10 default split)
- **Protocol (60%):** Withdrawn by `PROTOCOL_ROLE` holders to any address
- **Creator (30%):** Withdrawn by market creator, isolated per market
- **Oracle (10%):** Withdrawn by oracle address, cumulative across all markets

### Security
- **AccessControl:** Role-based permissions for all sensitive operations
- **ReentrancyGuard:** Protection on all withdrawal and collection functions
- **SafeERC20:** Safe token transfers to prevent common vulnerabilities

## Architecture

### Storage Structure

```solidity
// Fee split configuration
protocolFeeBps: uint256  // 6000 = 60%
creatorFeeBps: uint256   // 3000 = 30%
oracleBps: uint256       // 1000 = 10%

// Market registry
markets: mapping(uint256 => MarketInfo)
  - marketAddress: address
  - creator: address
  - registered: bool

// Balance tracking
protocolBalances: mapping(token => amount)
creatorBalances: mapping(marketId => mapping(token => amount))
oracleBalances: mapping(token => amount)
marketTotalFees: mapping(marketId => mapping(token => amount))
```

### Roles

1. **DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE**
   - Update fee split percentages
   - Set oracle address
   - Grant/revoke other roles

2. **PROTOCOL_ROLE**
   - Withdraw protocol fees

3. **MARKET_MANAGER_ROLE**
   - Register new markets

## Core Functions

### Market Registration

```solidity
function registerMarket(uint256 marketId, address marketAddress, address creator)
```

- Must be called by `MARKET_MANAGER_ROLE` before a market can collect fees
- Associates market ID with its contract address and creator
- Emits `MarketRegistered` event

**Requirements:**
- Valid non-zero addresses
- Market not already registered
- Caller has `MARKET_MANAGER_ROLE`

### Fee Collection

```solidity
function collect(uint256 marketId, address token, uint256 amount)
```

- Called by market contracts to deposit trading fees
- Automatically splits fees according to configured percentages
- Updates all balance mappings and analytics
- Emits `FeesCollected` event

**Requirements:**
- Market must be registered
- Caller must be the registered market address
- Amount > 0
- Market must have approved Treasury to transfer tokens

**Fee Split Formula:**
```
protocolAmount = (amount * protocolFeeBps) / 10000
creatorAmount = (amount * creatorFeeBps) / 10000
oracleAmount = (amount * oracleFeeBps) / 10000

// Handle rounding
if (protocolAmount + creatorAmount + oracleAmount < amount):
    protocolAmount += remainder
```

### Withdrawals

#### Protocol Withdrawal

```solidity
function withdrawProtocol(address token, address to, uint256 amount)
```

- Allows `PROTOCOL_ROLE` to withdraw accumulated protocol fees
- Can specify any recipient address
- Can do partial withdrawals

#### Creator Withdrawal

```solidity
function withdrawCreator(uint256 marketId, address token, uint256 amount)
```

- Market creator withdraws their accumulated fees
- Isolated per market (creator can only withdraw from their own markets)
- Automatically sends to `msg.sender` (must be market creator)

#### Oracle Withdrawal

```solidity
function withdrawOracle(address token, uint256 amount)
```

- Oracle withdraws accumulated fees from all markets
- Only callable by the registered oracle address
- Cumulative across all markets

### Admin Functions

#### Update Fee Split

```solidity
function updateFeeSplit(uint256 protocolBps_, uint256 creatorBps_, uint256 oracleBps_)
```

- Update fee distribution percentages
- Only affects future collections, not existing balances
- Must sum to exactly 10000 (100%)

#### Set Oracle

```solidity
function setOracle(address newOracle)
```

- Update oracle address for fee withdrawals
- Does not transfer existing oracle balance

## Integration Examples

### Market Integration

```solidity
// In LMSRMarket or MarketFactory
contract LMSRMarket {
    Treasury public treasury;
    uint256 public marketId;
    
    function _collectTradingFees(uint256 feeAmount) internal {
        // Approve treasury to take fees
        collateral.approve(address(treasury), feeAmount);
        
        // Treasury automatically splits fees
        treasury.collect(marketId, address(collateral), feeAmount);
    }
}
```

### Creator Withdrawal

```solidity
// Market creator checks and withdraws fees
uint256 balance = treasury.getCreatorBalance(marketId, address(usdt));
if (balance > 0) {
    treasury.withdrawCreator(marketId, address(usdt), balance);
}
```

### Protocol Dashboard

```solidity
// Admin dashboard checks total protocol fees
uint256 usdtBalance = treasury.getProtocolBalance(address(usdt));
uint256 totalMarket1Fees = treasury.getMarketTotalFees(1, address(usdt));
```

## Events

```solidity
event FeesCollected(
    uint256 indexed marketId,
    address indexed market,
    address indexed token,
    uint256 protocolAmount,
    uint256 creatorAmount,
    uint256 oracleAmount,
    uint256 totalAmount
);

event ProtocolWithdrawal(address indexed token, address indexed to, uint256 amount);
event CreatorWithdrawal(uint256 indexed marketId, address indexed creator, address indexed token, uint256 amount);
event OracleWithdrawal(address indexed oracle, address indexed token, uint256 amount);
event FeeSplitUpdated(uint256 protocolBps, uint256 creatorBps, uint256 oracleBps);
event MarketRegistered(uint256 indexed marketId, address indexed market, address indexed creator);
```

## Gas Optimization

- Single `collect()` call handles entire fee split
- Balance mappings avoid individual transfers
- Withdrawals use `SafeERC20` for efficiency
- No loops or unbounded operations

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Three-tiered role system prevents unauthorized access
- Creators can only withdraw from their own markets
- Oracle address is single-source-of-truth

### Reentrancy Protection
- `nonReentrant` modifier on all external state-changing functions
- Balance updates before transfers (checks-effects-interactions)

### Token Safety
- `SafeERC20` prevents common transfer vulnerabilities
- Zero address checks on all address parameters
- Amount validation (non-zero, sufficient balance)

### Rounding
- Remainder always goes to protocol (prevents griefing)
- No precision loss across splits

## Example Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Single Market Trading Fees

```
1. Market 1 collects 1000 USDT in fees
   - Protocol gets 600 USDT (60%)
   - Creator gets 300 USDT (30%)
   - Oracle gets 100 USDT (10%)

2. Protocol withdraws 300 USDT (partial)
   - Protocol balance: 300 USDT remaining

3. Creator withdraws full 300 USDT
   - Creator balance: 0 USDT

4. Oracle accumulates from multiple markets before withdrawing
```

### Scenario 2: Multiple Markets

```
Market 1: 1000 USDT fees → Creator1 gets 300 USDT
Market 2: 2000 USDT fees → Creator2 gets 600 USDT

Protocol balance: (1000 + 2000) * 0.6 = 1800 USDT (cumulative)
Creator1 balance: 300 USDT (isolated)
Creator2 balance: 600 USDT (isolated)
Oracle balance: (1000 + 2000) * 0.1 = 300 USDT (cumulative)
```

### Scenario 3: Fee Split Update

```
Old split: 60/30/10

Market collects 1000 USDT → Split using old percentages

Admin updates to 50/40/10

Market collects 2000 USDT → Split using new percentages

Previous balances remain unchanged, only new collections use new split
```

## Implementation Notes

### Design Decisions

1. **Centralized Treasury**
   - Single source of truth for all fee management
   - Easier to audit and upgrade
   - Simpler integration for markets

2. **Basis Points Configuration**
   - Flexible fee split percentages
   - Must sum to 10000 (100%)
   - Remainder handling prevents dust

3. **Market Registry**
   - Required registration prevents unauthorized collections
   - Associates market ID with creator for proper attribution
   - Enables analytics and reporting

4. **Isolated Creator Balances**
   - Creators can only withdraw from their own markets
   - Prevents cross-market balance manipulation
   - Clear audit trail per market

5. **Cumulative Protocol/Oracle Balances**
   - Simplifies withdrawal for platform operators
   - Reduces gas costs (single withdrawal vs per-market)
   - Oracle fees aggregate across all usage

### Future Enhancements

- [ ] Multi-token fee collection tracking
- [ ] Time-locked vesting for creator fees
- [ ] Emergency pause mechanism
- [ ] Fee split schedules (change over time)
- [ ] Beneficiary redirects (assign creator fees to another address)

## Dependencies
