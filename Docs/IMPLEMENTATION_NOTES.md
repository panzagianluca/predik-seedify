## üöß Pending Contracts

### Treasury.sol ‚ùå NOT STARTED
**Spec Reference:** contracts.md ¬ß6

**Required Features:**
- Fee collection from markets
- Fee splitting (protocol/creator/oracle shares)
- Role-gated withdrawals
- Per-market fee tracking for analytics

**Blockers:**
- None - can implement independently

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Can deploy basic version, enhance later

---

### MarketFactory.sol ‚ùå NOT STARTED
**Spec Reference:** contracts.md ¬ß1

**Required Features:**
- ERC-1167 clone deployment for gas efficiency
- Market creation with title/outcomes/deadline
- Global parameter management (default b, oracle, treasury addresses)
- Market registry (mapping marketId ‚Üí address)
- MarketCreated event emission

**Blockers:**
- Need to finalize LMSRMarket constructor parameters
- Need Treasury + Oracle deployed first

**Priority:** HIGH - Required for creating markets

**Design Decisions Needed:**
- Should we use minimal clones (ERC-1167) or standard deployment?
  - **Recommendation:** Use clones for gas savings
- How to assign marketId? Sequential counter vs hash?
  - **Recommendation:** Sequential counter (simpler, matches Myriad pattern)

---

## Summary Statistics

- **Total Tests**: 84 (83 passing, 1 flaky fuzz test)
- **Contracts Completed**: 5/7 (MockUSDT, Outcome1155, Router, Oracle, LMSRMarket partial)
- **Test Coverage by Contract**:
  - MockUSDT: 22 tests
  - Outcome1155: 11 tests
  - LMSRMarket: 7 tests
  - Router: 10 tests
  - Oracle: 32 tests
  - Counter (example): 2 tests
- **Remaining**: Treasury.sol, MarketFactory.sol, LMSRMarket resolution functions

---

## üîß Build Configuration Changes

### Foundry Config Updates

**File:** `foundry.toml`

**Change:** Enabled IR-based compilation
```toml
via_ir = true  # Changed from false
```

**Reason:** Router contract hit stack depth limits during compilation. Via-IR (intermediate representation) enables better optimization and deeper stack management.

**Impact:**
- ‚úÖ Compilation now succeeds for complex contracts
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Slightly slower compile times (~3-7s vs ~1s)
- ‚úÖ Better optimized bytecode

---

## üéØ Deviations from Spec

### 1. LMSRMarket Missing Features
**Spec:** contracts.md ¬ß2  
**Missing:**
- `requestResolve()` function
- `finalize(uint8 winning, bool invalid_)` function  
- `redeem(uint256 outcome, uint256 amount)` function
- Market state machine (Trading/Resolving/Finalized)
- Trading deadline enforcement (`tradingEndsAt`)

**Status:** ‚úÖ Ready to implement - Oracle complete  
**Justification:** These features require Oracle integration. Oracle is now complete with DelphAI integration and dispute mechanism.

**Action Required:** Add state transitions and resolution logic in next phase - Oracle provides finalize callback interface.

---

### 2. Router Multicall Implementation
**Spec:** contracts.md ¬ß5 suggests basic multicall  
**Implementation:** Uses `delegatecall` for flexibility

**Difference:**
```solidity
// Our implementation (delegatecall)
(bool success, bytes memory result) = address(this).delegatecall(calls[i]);

// Simpler alternative (call)
(bool success, bytes memory result) = address(this).call(calls[i]);
```

**Justification:** Delegatecall allows multicall to access Router storage/modifiers while maintaining msg.sender context. More flexible for future features.

**Security Note:** All Router functions are nonReentrant and access-controlled, so delegatecall is safe.

---

### 3. Enhanced Outcome1155 URI System
**Spec:** contracts.md ¬ß3 mentions "optional uri(tokenId)"  
**Implementation:** Full URI template system with placeholder replacement

**Added Features:**
- Dynamic `{id}` placeholder replacement
- 64-character hex padding for ERC-1155 standard compliance
- Fallback behavior when placeholder not found

**Justification:** Improves frontend integration and follows ERC-1155 metadata standard.

## üîç Known Issues / Tech Debt

1. **Stack Depth Workaround**
   - Issue: Router hit stack depth limits
   - Solution: Enabled `via_ir` compilation
   - Impact: Slower compile times but necessary for complex contracts
   - Status: ‚úÖ Resolved

2. **Missing Market State Management**
   - Issue: LMSRMarket has no state machine
   - Impact: Can't enforce trading deadlines or prevent trades after resolution
   - Status: ‚è≥ Deferred to Oracle implementation
   - Priority: HIGH

3. **No Fuzz Testing Yet**
   - Issue: LMSR math not thoroughly tested for edge cases
   - Impact: Potential precision issues or overflow vulnerabilities
   - Status: ‚è≥ Planned for Task 2
   - Priority: HIGH

4. **Codacy Limitations**
   - Issue: Codacy CLI doesn't support Solidity files
   - Impact: Can't run automated code quality checks
   - Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Accepted limitation
   - Workaround: Use Slither for static analysis

## üéì Lessons Learned

1. **PRBMath Integration**
   - UD60x18 provides excellent precision for LMSR calculations
   - Must be careful with exp() input range to avoid overflow
   - Conversion between raw uint256 and UD60x18 requires discipline

2. **OpenZeppelin v5 Changes**
   - SafeERC20 uses `forceApprove()` instead of `safeApprove()`
   - AccessControl now includes ERC165 support
   - Must properly override `supportsInterface()` when implementing multiple interfaces

3. **Foundry via-IR**
   - Necessary for complex contracts with deep call stacks
   - Compilation time increases ~3-5x
   - Worth it for maintainability vs manual stack optimization

4. **ERC-1155 Receiver Pattern**
   - Router must implement IERC1155Receiver to accept share transfers
   - Must return correct selector in `onERC1155Received()`
   - supportsInterface() must declare ERC1155Receiver support

---

## üìä Gas Optimization Notes

**Not yet profiled** - will measure after full implementation

**Expected high-gas operations:**
- LMSRMarket.buy() - exp/ln calculations expensive
- Router.buyWithPermit() - multiple external calls
- Outcome1155 batch operations - loops over arrays

**Optimization opportunities:**
- Use ERC-1167 clones for Market deployment (Factory)
- Cache array lengths in loops
- Use unchecked arithmetic where safe
- Consider packed structs for storage
