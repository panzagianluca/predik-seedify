## 🎯 Phase 1 Status: NEARLY COMPLETE

### Remaining Work

**No blocking issues remain.** All critical contract functionality is implemented and tested.

**Optional Enhancements (SHOULD DO from CONTRACT-FIXES-IMPLEMENTATION.md):**
- [ ] Decimal normalization helpers (6-decimal USDT ↔ 18-decimal UD60x18)
- [ ] Minimum liquidity parameter validation
- [ ] Outcome bounds checks in Oracle
- [ ] Additional events for frontend/subgraph
- [ ] Gas optimizations (unchecked loops, struct packing)

**Priority:** LOW - Can be implemented post-hackathon

---

## 🚧 Architecture Changes from Original Spec

### 1. USDT Bonds Instead of ETH (CRITICAL CHANGE)

**Original Design:**  
Oracle dispute bonds used ETH (`msg.value`, `payable` functions)

**Current Design:**  
Oracle dispute bonds use USDT via ERC20 approval pattern

**Rationale:**
- ✅ Aligns with USDT-native architecture (all settlement in USDT)
- ✅ Enables permit-based gasless disputes (Biconomy compatibility)
- ✅ Simplifies accounting (single collateral token)
- ✅ Matches user expectations (Argentine users hold USDT, not ETH)

**Files Changed:**
- `contracts/Oracle.sol` - dispute() no longer payable, uses `collateral.safeTransferFrom()`
- `contracts/Oracle.sol` - resolveDispute() sends USDT directly to treasury
- `test/Oracle.t.sol` - All dispute tests updated for USDT approval pattern

**Documentation Updated:**
- ✅ `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Updated dispute mechanism description
- ✅ `CONTRACT-FIXES-IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Documented as Fix #5
- ✅ `IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md` - Added to deviations section

---

### 2. Router Reentrancy Guard Refactoring

**Original Design:**  
All Router functions marked `nonReentrant`

**Current Design:**  
Only `multicall()` is `nonReentrant`, other functions call internal helpers

**Rationale:**
- ✅ Prevents delegatecall revert (multicall can't call nonReentrant functions)
- ✅ Maintains security (multicall is the only external entrypoint for batching)
- ✅ Cleaner architecture (separation of concerns)

---

### 3. Fee Sweep Pattern

**Original Design:**  
Not specified how fees move from markets to treasury

**Current Design:**  
Markets implement `sweepFeesToTreasury()` which calls `treasury.collect()`

**Rationale:**
- ✅ Push model is simpler than pull
- ✅ Admin-controlled timing (can batch multiple markets)
- ✅ Clear audit trail via events

---

## Summary Statistics

---

## 🔧 Build Configuration Changes

### Foundry Config Updates

**File:** `foundry.toml`

**Change:** Enabled IR-based compilation
```toml
via_ir = true  # Changed from false
```

**Reason:** Router contract hit stack depth limits during compilation. Via-IR (intermediate representation) enables better optimization and deeper stack management.

**Impact:**
- ✅ Compilation now succeeds for complex contracts
- ⚠️ Slightly slower compile times (~3-7s vs ~1s)
- ✅ Better optimized bytecode

---

## 🎯 Deviations from Spec

### 1. USDT Bonds Instead of ETH (MAJOR CHANGE) ✅ ALIGNED WITH ARCHITECTURE

**Spec:** Original design assumed ETH-based dispute bonds  
**Implementation:** USDT-based dispute bonds via ERC20 approval

**Changes:**
- Oracle.dispute() is no longer `payable`
- Oracle uses `collateral.safeTransferFrom()` to collect bonds
- Oracle.resolveDispute() sends USDT directly to treasury address
- Treasury does not need `receive()` function

**Status:** ✅ Fully implemented and tested  
**Justification:** 
- Aligns with USDT-native product architecture (all settlement in USDT)
- Enables gasless disputes via permit signatures (Biconomy compatibility)
- Simplifies accounting (single collateral token)
- Better UX for Argentine users (hold USDT, not ETH)

**Architecture Docs Updated:** ✅ ARCHITECTURE.md, CONTRACT-FIXES-IMPLEMENTATION.md

---

### 2. LMSRMarket Resolution Functions ✅ COMPLETE

**Spec:** contracts.md §2  
**Status:** ✅ Fully implemented

**Added Functions:**
- `requestResolve()` function ✅
- `finalize(uint8 winning, bool invalid_)` function ✅
- `redeem(uint256 outcome, uint256 amount)` function ✅
- Market state machine (Trading/Resolving/Finalized) ✅
- Trading deadline enforcement (`tradingEndsAt`) ✅
- `getTotalVolume()` getter for Oracle ✅
- `sweepFeesToTreasury()` for fee distribution ✅

**Action Required:** None - complete

---

### 3. Router Multicall Implementation ✅ REFACTORED
**Spec:** contracts.md §5 suggests basic multicall  
**Implementation:** Uses internal helpers with single `nonReentrant` guard

**Pattern:**
```solidity
// Public entrypoints (no guard)
function buyWithPermit(...) external returns (uint256) {
    return _buyWithPermit(...);
}

// Internal implementations (actual logic)
function _buyWithPermit(...) internal returns (uint256) {
    // Actual buy logic
}

// Only multicall has reentrancy guard
function multicall(bytes[] calldata calls) external nonReentrant returns (bytes[] memory) {
    // delegatecall to internal functions
}
```

**Justification:** Delegatecall + nonReentrant on called functions = revert. Solution: Guard only the top-level entrypoint.

**Security Note:** All Router functions are access-controlled and single-use collateral transfers, so this pattern is safe.

---

### 4. Enhanced Outcome1155 URI System ✅ UNCHANGED
**Spec:** contracts.md §3 mentions "optional uri(tokenId)"  
**Implementation:** Full URI template system with placeholder replacement

**Added Features:**
- Dynamic `{id}` placeholder replacement
- 64-character hex padding for ERC-1155 standard compliance
- Fallback behavior when placeholder not found

**Justification:** Improves frontend integration and follows ERC-1155 metadata standard.

## 🔍 Known Issues / Tech Debt

1. **Stack Depth Workaround**
   - Issue: Router hit stack depth limits
   - Solution: Enabled `via_ir` compilation
   - Impact: Slower compile times but necessary for complex contracts
   - Status: ✅ Resolved

2. **Decimal Normalization (Optional Enhancement)**
   - Issue: USDT uses 6 decimals, PRBMath expects 18 decimals
   - Current: Manual conversion in tests
   - Potential: Add helper functions for production safety
   - Status: ⚠️ Works but could be cleaner
   - Priority: LOW (post-hackathon)

3. **No Comprehensive Fuzz Testing Yet**
   - Issue: LMSR math not thoroughly fuzz-tested for edge cases
   - Impact: Potential precision issues or overflow vulnerabilities undiscovered
   - Status: ⏳ Basic tests pass, fuzz tests deferred
   - Priority: MEDIUM (pre-mainnet)

4. **Codacy Limitations**
   - Issue: Codacy CLI doesn't support Solidity files
   - Impact: Can't run automated code quality checks
   - Status: ⚠️ Accepted limitation
   - Workaround: Use Slither for static analysis

5. **Gas Optimizations Not Applied**
   - Issue: No gas optimization pass completed
   - Status: ⏳ Deferred to post-hackathon
   - Priority: LOW (BNB Chain gas is cheap)
   - Opportunities: unchecked loops, struct packing, storage caching

---

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. **PRBMath Integration**
   - UD60x18 provides excellent precision for LMSR calculations
   - Must be careful with exp() input range to avoid overflow
   - Conversion between raw uint256 and UD60x18 requires discipline

2. **OpenZeppelin v5 Changes**
   - SafeERC20 uses `forceApprove()` instead of `safeApprove()`
   - AccessControl now includes ERC165 support
   - Must properly override `supportsInterface()` when implementing multiple interfaces

3. **Foundry via-IR**
   - Necessary for complex contracts with deep call stacks
   - Compilation time increases ~3-5x
   - Worth it for maintainability vs manual stack optimization

4. **ERC-1155 Receiver Pattern**
   - Router must implement IERC1155Receiver to accept share transfers
   - Must return correct selector in `onERC1155Received()`
   - supportsInterface() must declare ERC1155Receiver support

5. **USDT-Native Architecture** ✨ NEW
   - Switching from ETH bonds to USDT bonds required updating 40+ test assertions
   - Using `vm.startPrank()` instead of `vm.prank()` is crucial for multi-call sequences
   - MockUSDT for testing requires owner-only minting to prevent unauthorized test minting

6. **Reentrancy Guard Patterns** ✨ NEW
   - `delegatecall` + `nonReentrant` = instant revert
   - Solution: Only guard the top-level multicall, internal helpers unguarded
   - Security maintained because multicall is the only batching entrypoint

---

## 📊 Gas Optimization Notes

**Not yet profiled** - will measure after full implementation

**Expected high-gas operations:**
- LMSRMarket.buy() - exp/ln calculations expensive
- Router.buyWithPermit() - multiple external calls
- Outcome1155 batch operations - loops over arrays

**Optimization opportunities:**
- Use ERC-1167 clones for Market deployment (Factory)
- Cache array lengths in loops
- Use unchecked arithmetic where safe
- Consider packed structs for storage
